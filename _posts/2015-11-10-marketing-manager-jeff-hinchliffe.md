Marketing Manager Jeff Hinchliffe 

Jeff is generally chilled out but is known to have a mad half hour now and again. He is young and learning quickly, but he seems to enjoy being in front of the lens rather than behind the camera. Jeff's formal job is to attract new customers, keep cats at bay and be the 2 Little Ducks mascot. (We are even considering including Pug rental for weddings), Check out his video
